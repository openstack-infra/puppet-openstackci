# OpenStack Third-Party CI

These instructions provide a **Third Party Testing** solution using the same
tools and scripts used by the OpenStack Infrastructure 'Jenkins' CI
system.

If you are setting up a similar system for use outside of OpenStack, many of these
steps are still valid, while others can be skipped. These will be mentioned within
each step.

If you are creating a third-party CI system for use within OpenStack,
you'll need to familiarize yourself with the contents of the
[third party manual](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/third_party.html),
and in particular you'll need to [create a service account]
(http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/third_party.html#creating-a-service-account).

## Overview

This CI solution uses a few open-source tools:

* [Jenkins](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/jenkins.html) - an open-source continuous integration server.

* [Zuul](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/zuul.html) - a project gating system

* [Nodepool](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/nodepool.html)- a node management system for testing

* [Jenkins Job Builder](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/jjb.html) - a tool to manage jenkins job definitions

* [os-loganalyze](http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/os-loganalyze/) - a tool to faciltate
  browsing, sharing, and filtering log files by log level.


The follow steps will help you integrate and deploy the first 4 tools on a single
host. An initial system with 8GB RAM, 4CPUs, 80GB HD should be sufficient,
running Ubuntu 14.04.

A second host will be used to store the log files and create a public log server to
host the static log files generated by jenkins jobs. This log server is an Apache
server serving log files stored on disk or on a Swift service.
It is hosted on a seperate server because it usually
needs to be publicly accessible to share job results whereas the rest of the CI
system can be located behind a firewall or within a VPN. At the end of a Jenkins Job,
`publishers` will scp log files from the jenkins slave to the log server or upload
to the Swift Service.

The system requires two external resources:

* A source for Nodepool nodes. This is a service that provides virtual machines
  (e.g. OpenStack - Nova) or bare metal (e.g. OpenStack - Ironic) that nodepool
  will manage as a pool of Jenkins slaves that will run the actual CI jobs.
  You can use a public or private OpenStack cloud, or even run your own
  [devstack](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-dev/devstack/) to get started.


* A Gerrit server (for OpenStack users, this is provided to you at review.openstack.org)
  Zuul will listen to the Gerrit even stream to decide which jobs to run when it receives
  a desired event. Zuul will also post a comment with results to this Gerrit with the
  job results along with a link to the related log files.

These instructions are for a 'masterless' puppet setup, which is the simplest
version to set up for those not familiar with puppet.


## Install and Configure Puppet

On each host, you will need to install and configure puppet.

### Install Puppet

Puppet is a tool to automate the installation of servers by defining the desired
end state. You can quickly install puppet along with basic tools (such as pip and git)
using this script:

    wget https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/system-config/plain/install_puppet.sh
    sudo bash install_puppet.sh

### Install Puppet Modules

You can get the latest version of the puppet modules needed using this script.

    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/system-config
    cd system-config
    sudo ./install_modules.sh
    cd ..

This script will install all the puppet modules used by upstream to
`/etc/puppet/modules`. In many cases, these are git cloned, and running
the `install_modules.sh` script again will update them to the latest version.
This script uses `modules.env` as its configuration input.

### Configure Masterless Puppet

First, it is useful to save the history, so set up a git repo as root user:

    cd /etc/puppet
    git init

You will be configuring 3 puppet files. The first is `site.pp` which is the top
level entry point for puppet to start managing the node. The second is a `hiera.yaml`
which configures Puppet Hiera to store local configurations and secrets
such as passwords and private keys, and finaly some `yaml` files which store the
actual configurations and secrets.

First, set up these 3 files by starting with the samples provided. For each host,
select the corresponding `single_node_ci*` or `log_server*` files.

    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/hiera.yaml /etc/puppet

    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/single_node_ci_site.pp /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/single_node_ci_data.yaml /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

    OR

    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/log_server_site.pp /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/log_server_data.yaml /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

At this point, you should not need to modify either of the first two files.
Modify `/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml` as you need using the parameter
documentation described in `../manifests/single_node_ci.pp` or
`../manifests/logserver.pp` (which is
the top level puppet class that is used in `site.pp`).

Once completed, you should commit these 3 files to the `/etc/puppet` git repo.

# Setup the log server

Setup the log server first, because it is simpler, and its FQDN (or IP address)
will be needed when setting up the CI server.

While setting up jenkins_ssh_public_key in `common.yaml` it is important that
the same ssh key pair is used when setting up the CI server in the next step.
This is the ssh key that Jenkins will use to scp files.

At this point you are ready to invoke Puppet for the first time. Puppet needs to
be run as root.

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

You can simulate a jenkins file upload using:

    scp -i $JENKINS_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $your-log-file jenkins@<fqdn_or_ip>:/srv/static/logs/

You should now be able to see the file you uploaded at `http://<fqnd_or_ip>/$your-log-file`

# Setup the CI server

## Create an Initial 'project-config' Repository

Setting up a CI system consists of two major operational aspects. The first is
system configuration, which focuses on the installation and deployment of the
services, including any ssh keys, credentials, databases, etc., and ensure all
system components are able to interact together. This portion is
performed by a System Administrator.

The second is project configuration, which includes the configuration files
that the services use to perform the desired project-specific operations.

The instructions provided here are mainly focused on the system configuration aspect.
However, they need an initial set of project configurations in order to work. These
project configurations are provided via a git URL to a `project-config` repository.
Before moving on, create an initial `project-config` repository. You can start with this
[project-config-example](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config-example/)
following the instructions provided in its README.md. While tailored for OpenStack users,
the instructions provided will help non-OpenStack users also start with this repository.
After your system is deployed, you can make further changes to the `project-config`
repository to continuously tailor it to your needs.

## Add 'jenkins' to your host name

Add 'jenkins' to your /etc/hosts file so that Apache (which will be installed by
the puppet scripts) is happy. This is needed because the scripts will install
multiple services on a single node. For example:

    head -n 1 /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1 localhost jenkins

## Run masterless Puppet

At this point you are ready to invoke Puppet for the first time. Puppet needs to
be run as root.

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

Puppet will install nodepool, jenkins, zuul, jenkins jobs builder, etc.

Your `project-config` repository will be cloned to /etc/project-config, and the puppet scripts
will use these configuration files located in this folder. Do not update these files directly.
Instead, you should update them from a clone on a dev host, merge the changes to master, and push
them to the same git remote location. Puppet will always pull down the latest version of master
from the git remote and use that to update services.

If you get the following error, manually run the failed `jenkins-jobs update` command with
the arguments specified in the error message as root. This is caused by a bug in the puppet
scripts where Jenkins is not yet running when Jenkins Job Builder attempts to load the
Jenkins jobs.

    Notice: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]/returns: jenkins.JenkinsException: Error in request: [Errno 111] Connection refused
    Notice: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]/returns: INFO:jenkins_jobs.builder:Cache saved
    Error: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]: Failed to call refresh: jenkins-jobs update --delete-old /etc/jenkins_jobs/config returned 1 instead of one of [0]
    Error: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]: jenkins-jobs update --delete-old /etc/jenkins_jobs/config returned 1 instead of one of [0]


## Restart apache if necessary

There are some known issues with Puppet automation. If you get the following error:

    AH00526: Syntax error on line 21 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/50-<fqdn/ip>.conf:
    Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration

A simple restart works around the issue:

    sudo service apache2 restart

## Start zuul

We'll start zuul first:

    sudo service zuul start
    sudo service zuul-merger start

You should see 2 zuul-server processes and 1 zuul-merger process

    ps -ef | grep zuul
    zuul      5722     1  2 18:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/zuul-server
    zuul      5725  5722  0 18:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/zuul-server
    zuul      5741     1  2 18:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/zuul-merger

You can view the log files for any errors:

    view /var/log/zuul/zuul.log

Most zuul files are located in either. They should not need to be modified directly, but
are useful to help identify root causes:

    /var/lib/zuul
    /etc/zuul

## Start nodepool

The first time starting nodepool, it's recommended to manually build the image
to aid in debugging any issues:


    sudo su - nodepool

    # Ensure the NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY variable is in the environment
    # Otherwise nodepool won't be able to ssh into nodes based
    # on the image built manually using these instructions
    source /etc/default/nodepool

    # In the command below <image-name> references one of the
    # images defined in your project-config/nodepool/nodepool.yaml
    # file as the 'name' field in the section 'diskimages'.
    nodepool image-build <image-name>

If you run into issues building the image, the [documentation provided
here can help you debug](https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config/tree/nodepool/elements/README.rst)


After you have sucessfully built an image, manually upload it to the provider to ensure
provider authentication and image uploading work:

    nodepool image-upload all <image-name>

Once successful, you can start nodepool.
(Note that if you don't yet have an image, this is one of the first actions nodepool
will do when it starts, before creating any nodes):

    sudo service nodepool start

You should see at least one process running. In particular:

    ps -ef | grep nodepool
    nodepool  5786     1 28 18:14 ?        00:00:01 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nodepoold -c /etc/nodepool/nodepool.yaml -l /etc/nodepool/logging.conf

## Setup Jenkins

First Restart Jenkins so that plugins will be fully installed:

    sudo service jenkins restart

Then open the Jenkins UI to finish manual configuration steps.

Enable Gearman, which is the Jenkins plugin zuul uses to queue jobs:

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Configure System
    Under "Gearman Plugin Config" Check the box "Enable Gearman"
    Click "Test Connection" It should return success if zuul is running.

Enable ZMQ Event Publisher, which is how nodepool is notified of Jenkin
slaves status events:

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Configure System
    Under "ZMQ Event Publisher"
    Check the box "Enable on all Jobs"

## Securing Jenkins (optional)

By default, Jenkins is installed with security disabled. While this is fine
for development environments where external access to Jenkins UI is restricted,
you are strongly encouraged to enable it. You can skip this step and do it
at a later time if you wish:

Create a jenkins 'credentials':

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Add Credentials --> SSH Username with private key
    Username 'jenkins'
    Private key --> From a file  on Jenkins master
    "/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa"
    --> Save

Save the credential uuid in your hiera data:

    sudo su jenkins
    cat /var/lib/jenkins/credentials.xml | grep "<id>"
    Copy the id to the 'jenkins_credentials_id' value in  /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

Enable basic Jenkins security:

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Configure Global Security
    Check "Enable Security"
    Under "Security Realm"
    Select Jenkin's own user database
    Uncheck allow users to sign up
    Under "Authorization" select "logged-in users can do anything"

    Create a user 'jenkins'
    Choose a password.
    check 'Sign up'
    Save the password to the 'jenkins_password' value in /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

Get the new 'jenkins' user API token:

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> People --> Select user 'jenkins' --> configure --> Show API Token
    Save this token to the 'jenkins_api_key' value in /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

Reconfigure your system to use Jenkins security settings stored in
`/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml`

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

# Updating your masterless puppet hosts

Any time you check-in changes to your `project-config` repo, make changes to the
hiera data (`/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml`), or update
the puppet files (in /etc/puppet/modules, either manually or via the `install_modules.sh` script),
run the same puppet command to update the host.

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

If you need to change the git url in your `project-config` or any other git urls
in your `common.yaml`, delete the respective repository, e.g.
`/etc/project-config`, and puppet will reclone it from the new location when the above `puppet apply`
command is reinvoked.

Note that it is safe, and expected, to rerun the above `puppet apply` command. Puppet will
update the configuration of the host as described in the puppet classes. This means that if
you delete or modify any files managed by puppet, rerunning the `puppet apply` command will
restore those settings back to the specified state (and remove your local changes for better or worse).
You could even run the `puppet apply` command as a cron job to enable continuous deployment
in your CI system.
