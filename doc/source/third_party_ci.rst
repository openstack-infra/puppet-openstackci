OpenStack Third-Party CI
========================

These instructions provide a **Third Party Testing** solution using the
same tools and scripts used by the OpenStack Infrastructure 'Jenkins' CI
system.

If you are setting up a similar system for use outside of OpenStack,
many of these steps are still valid, while others can be skipped. These
will be mentioned within each step.

If you are creating a third-party CI system for use within OpenStack,
you'll need to familiarize yourself with the contents of the `third
party
manual <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/third_party.html>`__,
and in particular you'll need to [create a service account]
(http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/third\_party.html#creating-a-service-account).

Overview
--------

This CI solution uses a few open-source tools:

-  `Jenkins <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/jenkins.html>`__
   - an open-source continuous integration server.

-  `Zuul <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/zuul.html>`__ -
   a project gating system

-  `Nodepool <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/nodepool.html>`__-
   a node management system for testing

-  `Jenkins Job
   Builder <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/jjb.html>`__ -
   a tool to manage jenkins job definitions

-  `os-loganalyze <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/os-loganalyze/>`__
   - a tool to facilitate browsing, sharing, and filtering log files by
   log level.

The following steps will help you integrate and deploy the first 4 tools
on a single node. An initial system with 8GB RAM, 4CPUs, 80GB HD should
be sufficient, running Ubuntu 14.04.

A second node will be used to store the log files and create a public
log server to host the static log files generated by jenkins jobs. This
log server node is an Apache server serving log files stored on disk or
on a Swift service. It is hosted on a separate node because it usually
needs to be publicly accessible to share job results whereas the rest of
the CI system can be located behind a firewall or within a VPN. At the
end of a Jenkins Job, ``publishers`` will scp log files from the jenkins
slave to the log server node or upload to the Swift Service.

The system requires two external resources:

-  A source for Nodepool nodes. This is a service that implements the
   OpenStack Nova API to provide virtual machines or bare metal nodes.
   Nodepool will use this service to manage a pool of Jenkins slaves
   that will run the actual CI jobs. You can use a public or private
   OpenStack cloud, or even run your own
   `devstack <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-dev/devstack/>`__
   to get started.

-  A Gerrit server (for OpenStack users, this is provided to you at
   review.openstack.org) Zuul will listen to the Gerrit event stream to
   decide which jobs to run when it receives a desired event. Zuul will
   also post a comment with results to this Gerrit server with the job
   results along with a link to the related log files.

These instructions are for a 'masterless' puppet setup, which is the
simplest version to set up for those not familiar with puppet.

Install and Configure Puppet
----------------------------

On each node, you will need to install and configure puppet. These
scripts assume a dedicated 'clean' node built with a base `ubuntu 14.04
server image <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server>`__.

Install Puppet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Puppet is a tool to automate the installation of servers by defining the
desired end state. You can quickly install puppet along with basic tools
(such as pip and git) using this script:

::

    sudo su -
    wget https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/system-config/plain/install_puppet.sh
    bash install_puppet.sh
    exit

Install Puppet Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get the latest version of the puppet modules needed using this
script.

::

    sudo su -
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/system-config
    cd system-config
    ./install_modules.sh
    exit

This script will install all the puppet modules used by upstream to
``/etc/puppet/modules``. In many cases, these are git cloned, and
running the ``install_modules.sh`` script again will update them to the
latest version. This script uses ``modules.env`` as its configuration
input.

Configure Masterless Puppet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The instructions in this section apply to both the single-node CI server
node as well as the log server node.

It is useful to save the history, so set up a git repo as root user:

::

    sudo su -
    cd /etc/puppet
    git init
    echo "modules/" >> .gitignore
    git add .
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git commit -m "initial files"
    exit

You will be configuring 3 puppet files. The first is ``site.pp`` which
is the top level entry point for puppet to start managing the node. The
second is a ``hiera.yaml`` which configures Puppet Hiera to store local
configurations and secrets such as passwords and private keys, and
finally some ``yaml`` files which store the actual configurations and
secrets.

Set up these 3 files by starting with the samples provided. For each
node, select the corresponding ``single_node_ci*`` or ``log_server*``
files.

Configure Puppet ``hiera.yaml`` so that puppet knows where to look for the
``common.yaml`` file you'll create in the next step.
::

    sudo su -
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/hiera.yaml /etc/puppet
    exit


If setting up the ``single node ci`` node:
::

    sudo su -
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/single_node_ci_site.pp /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/single_node_ci_data.yaml /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml
    exit

If setting up the ``log server`` node:
::

    sudo su -
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/log_server_site.pp /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
    cp /etc/puppet/modules/openstackci/contrib/log_server_data.yaml /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml
    exit

Modify ``/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml`` as you need using
the parameter documentation described in
`single\_node\_ci.pp <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/puppet-openstackci/tree/manifests/single_node_ci.pp>`__
or
`logserver.pp <http://git.openstack .org/cgit/openstack-infra/puppet-openstackci/tree/manifests/logserver.pp>`__.
These are the top level puppet class that is used in ``site.pp``.

One parameter called ``project_config_repo`` is necessary to be set
into ``/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml``.

You need to configure this parameter with the URL of the 'project-config'
repository which you will create in the step
`Create an Initial 'project-config' Repository`_ below.

Once completed, you should commit these 3 files to the ``/etc/puppet``
git repo. Your git workflow may vary a bit, but here is an example:

::

    sudo su -
    cd /etc/puppet
    git checkout -b setup
    git add environments/common.yaml
    # repeat for other modified files
    git commit -a -m 'initial setup'
    exit

Set up the log server
=====================

Set up the log server node first as it is simpler to configure. Besides,
its FQDN (or IP address) is needed to set up the CI server node.

While setting up jenkins\_ssh\_public\_key in ``common.yaml`` it is
important that the same ssh key pair is used when setting up the CI
server node in the next step. This is the ssh key that Jenkins will use
to scp files.

At this point you are ready to invoke Puppet for the first time. Puppet
needs to be run as root.

::

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

You can simulate a jenkins file upload using:

::

    scp -i $JENKINS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $your-log-file jenkins@<fqdn_or_ip>:/srv/static/logs/

You should now be able to see the file you uploaded at
``http://<fqnd_or_ip>/$your-log-file``

Set up the CI server
====================

Follow the steps above to install and configure puppet on the CI server
node.

Create an Initial 'project-config' Repository
---------------------------------------------

Setting up a CI system consists of two major operational aspects. The
first is system configuration, which focuses on the installation and
deployment of the services, including any ssh keys, credentials,
databases, etc., and ensure all system components are able to interact
together. This portion is performed by a System Administrator.

The second is project configuration, which includes the configuration
files that the services use to perform the desired project-specific
operations.

The instructions provided here are mainly focused on the system
configuration aspect. However, system configuration requires an initial
set of project configurations in order to work. These project
configurations are provided via a git URL to a ``project-config``
repository. Before moving on, create an initial ``project-config``
repository. You can start with this
`project-config-example <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config-example/>`__
following the instructions provided in its README.md. While tailored for
OpenStack users, the instructions provided will help non-OpenStack users
also start with this repository. After your system is deployed, you can
make further changes to the ``project-config`` repository to
continuously tailor it to your needs.

Add 'jenkins' to your host name
-------------------------------

Add 'jenkins' to your /etc/hosts file so that Apache (which will be
installed by the puppet scripts) is happy. This is needed because the
scripts will install multiple services on a single node. For example:

::

    head -n 1 /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1 localhost jenkins

Run masterless Puppet
---------------------

At this point you are ready to invoke Puppet for the first time. Puppet
needs to be run as root.

::

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

Puppet will install nodepool, jenkins, zuul, jenkins jobs builder, etc.

Your ``project-config`` repository will be cloned to
/etc/project-config, and the puppet scripts will use these configuration
files located in this folder. Do not update these files directly.
Instead, you should update them from a clone on a dev host, merge the
changes to master, and push them to the same git remote location. Puppet
will always pull down the latest version of master from the git remote
and use that to update services.

If you get the following error, manually run the failed
``jenkins-jobs update`` command with the arguments specified in the
error message as root. This is caused by a bug in the puppet scripts
where Jenkins is not yet running when Jenkins Job Builder attempts to
load the Jenkins jobs.

::

    Notice: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]/returns: jenkins.JenkinsException: Error in request: [Errno 111] Connection refused
    Notice: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]/returns: INFO:jenkins_jobs.builder:Cache saved
    Error: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]: Failed to call refresh: jenkins-jobs update --delete-old /etc/jenkins_jobs/config returned 1 instead of one of [0]
    Error: /Stage[main]/Jenkins::Job_builder/Exec[jenkins_jobs_update]: jenkins-jobs update --delete-old /etc/jenkins_jobs/config returned 1 instead of one of [0]

Restart apache if necessary
---------------------------

There are some known issues with Puppet automation. If you get the
following error:

::

    AH00526: Syntax error on line 21 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/50-<fqdn/ip>.conf:
    Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration

A simple restart works around the issue:

::

    sudo service apache2 restart

Start zuul
----------

We'll start zuul first:

::

    sudo service zuul start
    sudo service zuul-merger start

You should see 2 zuul-server processes and 1 zuul-merger process

::

    ps -ef | grep zuul
    zuul      5722     1  2 18:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/zuul-server
    zuul      5725  5722  0 18:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/zuul-server
    zuul      5741     1  2 18:13 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/zuul-merger

You can view the log files for any errors:

::

    view /var/log/zuul/zuul.log

Most zuul files are located in either of the following directories. They
should not need to be modified directly, but are useful to help identify
root causes:

::

    /var/lib/zuul
    /etc/zuul

Start nodepool
--------------

The first time starting nodepool, it's recommended to manually build the
image to aid in debugging any issues. To do that, first, initiate the
nodepool-builder service:

::

    sudo service nodepool-builder start

The nodepool-builder service is responsible for receiving image building
requests and calling Disk Image Builder to carry on the image creation.
You can see its logs by typing:

::

    view /var/log/nodepool/nodepool-builder.log

Next, log into the nodepool user to issue manually the image building:

::

    sudo su - nodepool

    # Ensure the NODEPOOL_SSH_KEY variable is in the environment
    # Otherwise nodepool won't be able to ssh into nodes based
    # on the image built manually using these instructions
    source /etc/default/nodepool

    # In the command below <image-name> references one of the
    # images defined in your project-config/nodepool/nodepool.yaml
    # file as the 'name' field in the section 'diskimages'.
    nodepool image-build <image-name>

You can follow the image creation process by seeing the image creation
log:

::

    tail -f /var/log/nodepool/image/image.log

If you run into issues building the image, the `documentation provided
here can help you
debug <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config/tree/nodepool/elements/README.rst>`__

After you have successfully built an image, manually upload it to the
provider to ensure provider authentication and image uploading work:

::

    nodepool image-upload all <image-name>

Once successful, you can start nodepool. (Note that if you don't yet
have an image, this is one of the first actions nodepool will do when it
starts, before creating any nodes):

::

    sudo service nodepool start

You should see at least one process running. In particular:

::

    ps -ef | grep nodepool
    nodepool  5786     1 28 18:14 ?        00:00:01 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nodepoold -c /etc/nodepool/nodepool.yaml -l /etc/nodepool/logging.conf

After building and uploading the images to the providers, nodepool will
start to build nodes on those providers based on the image and will
register those nodes as jenkins slaves.

If that does not happen, the nodepool log files will help identify the
causes.

::

    view /var/log/nodepool/nodepool.log
    view /var/log/nodepool/debug.log

Most nodepool configuration files are located in either of the following
directories. They should never to be modified directly as puppet will
overwrite any changes, but are useful to help identify root causes:

::

    /etc/nodepool
    /home/nodepool/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml

Setup Jenkins
-------------

First Restart Jenkins so that plugins will be fully installed:

::

    sudo service jenkins restart

Then open the Jenkins UI to finish manual configuration steps.

Enable Gearman, which is the Jenkins plugin zuul uses to queue jobs:

::

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Configure System
    For "Gearman Server Port" use port number 4730
    Under "Gearman Plugin Config" Check the box "Enable Gearman"
    Click "Test Connection" It should return success if zuul is running.

The zuul process is running a gearman server on port 4730. To check the status
of gearman: on your zuul node telnet to 127.0.0.1 port 4730, and issue the
command ``status`` to get status information about the jobs registered in
gearman.

::

    echo 'status' | nc 127.0.0.1 4730 -w 1

The output of the ``status`` command contains tab separated columns with the
following information.

1. Name: The name of the job.
2. Number in queue: The total number of jobs in the queue including the
currently running ones (next column).
3. Number of jobs running: The total number of jobs currently running.
4. Number of capable workers: A maximum possible count of workers that can run
this job. This number being zero is one reason zuul reports "NOT Registered".

::

    build:noop-check-communication    1    0    1
    build:dsvm-tempest-full           2    1    1


Enable ZMQ Event Publisher, which is how nodepool is notified of Jenkin
slaves status events:

::

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Configure System
    Under "ZMQ Event Publisher"
    Check the box "Enable on all Jobs"

Securing Jenkins (optional)
---------------------------

By default, Jenkins is installed with security disabled. While this is
fine for development environments where external access to Jenkins UI is
restricted, you are strongly encouraged to enable it. You can skip this
step and do it at a later time if you wish:

Create a jenkins 'credentials':

::

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Add Credentials --> SSH Username with private key
    Username 'jenkins'
    Private key --> From a file  on Jenkins master
    "/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa"
    --> Save

Save the credential uuid in your hiera data:

::

    sudo su jenkins
    cat /var/lib/jenkins/credentials.xml | grep "<id>"
    Copy the id to the 'jenkins_credentials_id' value in  /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

Enable basic Jenkins security:

::

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> Configure Global Security
    Check "Enable Security"
    Under "Security Realm"
    Select Jenkin's own user database
    Uncheck allow users to sign up
    Under "Authorization" select "logged-in users can do anything"

    Create a user 'jenkins'
    Choose a password.
    check 'Sign up'
    Save the password to the 'jenkins_password' value in /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

Get the new 'jenkins' user API token:

::

    http://<host fqdn/ip>:8080/
    Manage Jenkins --> People --> Select user 'jenkins' --> configure --> Show API Token
    Save this token to the 'jenkins_api_key' value in /etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml

Reconfigure your system to use Jenkins security settings stored in
``/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml``

::

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

Updating your masterless puppet hosts
=====================================

Any time you check-in changes to your ``project-config`` repo, make
changes to the hiera data (``/etc/puppet/environments/common.yaml``), or
update the puppet files (in /etc/puppet/modules, either manually or via
the ``install_modules.sh`` script), run the same puppet command to
update the host.

::

    sudo puppet apply --verbose /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

If you need to change the git url in your ``project-config`` or any
other git urls in your ``common.yaml``, delete the respective
repository, e.g. ``/etc/project-config``, and puppet will reclone it
from the new location when the above ``puppet apply`` command is
reinvoked.

Note that it is safe, and expected, to rerun the above ``puppet apply``
command. Puppet will update the configuration of the host as described
in the puppet classes. This means that if you delete or modify any files
managed by puppet, rerunning the ``puppet apply`` command will restore
those settings back to the specified state (and remove your local
changes for better or worse). You could even run the ``puppet apply``
command as a cron job to enable continuous deployment in your CI system.
